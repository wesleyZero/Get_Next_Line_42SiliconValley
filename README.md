# GetNextLine : A copy of the getline() function in C 

## 42 Silicon Valley
This project was done at a free coding school called '42 Silicon Valley', which was unfortunately shut down permanently after the 2020 pandemic. It originally started in france, this is the [french '42' school's website](https://42.fr/en/homepage/). The US 42 schools website was shutdown but their [old instagram](https://www.instagram.com/42siliconvalley/?hl=en) is still up if you are curious what the school was about.

#### How did this coding school work?
At 42 you were not allowed to use almost any libraries whatsoever. You had to build everything from scratch. 42 had no in-person instructors, it was a self taught school.

## Description 

To see the school's project instructions read the [PDF Instructions](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Get_Next_Line_42SiliconValley/blob/main/README_RESOURCES/get_next_line.pdf). To see my logic, see the [Logic Flow Chart](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Get_Next_Line_42SiliconValley/blob/main/README_RESOURCES/Get_next_line_FLOWCHART.pdf).

### What is getnextline? 
 The program has the same functionality of 'getline' from the stdio library in C. I coded this from scratch (no googling to cheat, beyond syntactic & symantic errors) to exercise my logic. It reads in a file line by line into a buffer, until the entire file is read.
